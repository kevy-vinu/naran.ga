A cousin of mine writes short stories. One sunny day, I asked if he wanted a blog to showcase his works and he agreed. I decided to create a minimal white paper like blog that people can just simply read. After a long research, I stumbled upon this beautiful blog template from a developer [Chester How](https://github.com/chesterhow).

Here we publish [malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam) contents only. The title 'naranga' is nothing but a real lemon fruit that we can use as an invisible ink sometimes.

## Contribute
Feel free to create some contents here by mailing my [cousin](mailto:arunvinu26.gmail.com) your works.

Thanks for reading!
