A cousin of mine writes short stories. One sunny day, I asked if he wanted a blog to showcase his works and he agreed. I decided to create a minimal white paper like blog that people can just simply read. After a long research, I stumbled upon this beautiful blog template from a developer [Chester How](https://github.com/chesterhow).

Here we publish [malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam) contents only. And in this moment, let me ask a sarcastic question. മലയാളം മലയാളികൾക്ക് സെക്കന്റ് ലാംഗ്വേജ് ആണോ? That's how I came up with this (maybe strange) blog title.

## Contribute
Feel free to create some contents here by mailing my [cousin](mailto:arunvinu26.gmail.com) your works.

Thanks for reading!
